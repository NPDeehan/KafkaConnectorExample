# Camunda & Kafka Connector Example

![stockExample](/img/kafkaStockExample.png)

### Credentials and Account Creation

You‚Äôll need a Kafka instance running. (the easiest place to do that is [confluent.cloud](https://confluent.cloud/)). You‚Äôll need a Camunda 8 Cluster (the easiest place to do that is [Camunda SaaS](https://signup.camunda.com/accounts)). Then the fun can start.
 
Connecting the two systems requires authentication and from your Kafka instance you‚Äôll need the following.

* **Username** -  You‚Äôll get this from creating an API Key for your Kafka instance
* **Password** - Same as the username, it‚Äôs part of the API Key creation
* **Bootstrap** **Server** - After you create a Kafka cluster you‚Äôll find this in the cluster settings.

üîê It‚Äôs important to know that it‚Äôs best practice not to simply copy and paste this sensitive information directly into the model but rather to [create a secret](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/console/manage-clusters/manage-secrets/) for each of these in your Camunda cluster. Then you can reference it by typing `{{secrete.yourSecreteHere}}` followed by the name of the key you want to access. 

For this example to work you'll need to create secretes with the following names:
* KafkaUsername
* KafkaPassword
* KafkaBootstrapServer

Now you‚Äôre ready to upload and deploy the process.

### Deploy and Start

Simply upload the bpmn model to your Camunda 8 account. From the modeler you can deploy the process to a cluster. 

To start an instance you can create a message on your Kafka cluster to a topic called `newDetails`
The message payload should look like this:

``` JSON
{
  "name" : "Niall",
  "details" : "Great Hawks Inc.",
  "value" : 1000000,
  "newStock" : true
}
```
The message should then be picked up by the start event and a process instance should start.
